## 📦 Installation

### From Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store listing](#)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Done! Visit any Swagger page to see it in action

### Manual Installation (Developer Mode)

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swagger-to-scalar.git
   cd swagger-to-scalar
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)

4. Click "Load unpacked"

5. Select the `extension` folder from this repository

6. The extension is now installed! Visit any Swagger UI page to test it

## 🚀 Usage

1. Navigate to any page with Swagger UI (e.g., `https://example.com/swagger`)
2. The page automatically converts to Scalar
3. Use the toggle button (top right) to switch back to Swagger anytime
4. Your preference is saved and restored on page reload

## 🔧 Supported Pages

Works on pages matching these patterns:

- `*://*/swagger/*`
- `*://*/api-docs*`
- `*://*/swagger-ui.html*`

## 🛠️ Development

### Project Structure

```
swagger-to-scalar/
├── extension/
│   ├── content.js       # Main extension logic
│   ├── manifest.json    # Extension configuration
│   └── icons/           # Extension icons
├── PRIVACY.md           # Privacy policy
├── LICENSE              # MIT License
└── README.md            # This file
```

### How It Works

1. **Detection**: Content script waits for `.swagger-ui` element to appear
2. **Spec Extraction**: Extracts the OpenAPI spec URL from Swagger's config
3. **Injection**: Creates an iframe with Scalar, pointing to the same spec
4. **Toggle**: Provides a button to switch between Swagger and Scalar views
5. **Persistence**: Stores view preference in localStorage

### Key Technologies

- **Manifest V3** - Latest Chrome extension standard
